Although Springboot/Spring has become the standard in Java projects, in order to take care of the small partners who enable other frameworks (the more important reason is that the strong coupling Spring I always think is a flaw, a bit of code cleanliness), now in the non-Spring system The convenience and efficiency brought by the LiteFlow framework can also be used in a different environment.

More than 98% of the features and functions mentioned in the LiteFlow documentation can take effect in non-Spring systems. Among the features and functions that do not take effect are:

- The fuzzy path matching feature of ruleSource does not take effect in non-Spring systems
- LiteflowComponent annotations cannot be used in non-Spring systems
- The monitoring function cannot be used in non-Spring systems
