LiteFlow supports the component parameter feature since v2.9.0. You can set external parameters for components in EL syntax.

This is a very useful feature for orchestrating the same components.

You can use the `data` keyword to set external parameters for a component, preferably in JSON format:

```xml
<flow>
    <chain name="chain1">
        cmpData = '{"name":"jack","age":27,"birth":"1995-10-01"}';
    
        THEN(a, b.data(cmpData), c);
    </chain>
    
    <chain name="chain2">
        cmpData = '{"name":"rose","age":20,"birth":"1997-07-01"}';
    
        WHEN(c, b.data(cmpData));
    </chain>
</flow>
```

In the above expression, the same b component is given different external parameters in different chains, and the corresponding parameters can also be obtained through the `getCmpData` method in the component during operation.

This method can return the java object of the corresponding structure, as long as the corresponding class is passed in.

```java
@Component("b")
public class BCmp extends NodeComponent {

	@Override
	public void process() {
		User user = this.getCmpData(User.class);
		...
	}
}
```
