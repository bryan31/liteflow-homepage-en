## Printing during chain execution

When executing a chain, you will see something like the following in the logs:

```
[ea1af4810cc849d58948d091d858b29a]:[O]start component[ACmp] execution
[ea1af4810cc849d58948d091d858b29a]:[O]start component[BCmp] execution
[ea1af4810cc849d58948d091d858b29a]:[X]start component[CCmp] execution
[ea1af4810cc849d58948d091d858b29a]:[O]start component[DCmp] execution
```

The first sequence number represents the request ID of the request. No matter how many components a request has gone through, their request IDs are the same. You can quickly locate and troubleshoot in the log based on this ID.

It will be followed by an [O] or [X], [O] represents the main logic that executes the component, and [X] represents the main logic that did not enter the component because `isAccess()` returned false.

If you don't want to print this kind of intermediate execution information, LiteFlow provides configuration items, you need to do the following settings:

```properties
liteflow.print-execution-log=false
```


## Printing step information

After executing a chain, the framework will automatically print the sequence of execution steps of this chain, as shown below:

```
a<100>==>c<10>==>m<0>==>q<200>==>p<300>==>p1<0>==>g<305>
```

The expression here is: `component ID <time in milliseconds>`


If you want to add an alias description when printing the process chain, you need to set the name attribute when defining the component. For details, please refer to [Component Aliases](/pages/92ef89/).

After adding the alias, the printing of the execution step information will become as follows:
```
a[cmpA]<100>==>b[cmpB]<0>==>m[cmpM]<256>
```

The expression here is: `component ID[component alias]<time in milliseconds>`
