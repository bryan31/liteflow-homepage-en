LiteFlow supports private delivery feature.


## What is private delivery

In the previous introduction, it has been explained that in a request, all components of LiteFLow share the same context.

In a request, all data in the context is exposed to all nodes in the request chain. Every component can access data.

But there is such a situation, such as my rule is defined like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<flow>
    <chain name="chain1">
        THEN(
            a,
            WHEN(b, b, b, b, b),
            c
        );
    </chain>
</flow>
```

After executing component a, the same 5 components b are concurrently executed. The logic on the b component is the same, but it needs to receive 5 different parameters.

We know that in the previous description, the a component can put data in the context, and other components can get what the a component puts in the context, but in this scenario, the ordinary storage data cannot allow the b component to get 5 Different parameters for concurrent processing.


:::tip concept
LiteFlow defines the concept of private delivery, which means that a component can explicitly declare to deliver one or more parameters for a specific component, and the delivered parameters can only be obtained by this specific component, and the delivered parameters can only be taken once.

With this feature, the above scenarios can be solved.



## Solution

We first define component a:

```java
@LiteflowComponent("a")
public class ACmp extends NodeComponent {
	@Override
	public void process() {
		System.out.println("ACmp executed!");
		DefaultContext context = this.getContextBean(DefaultContext.class);
		context.setData("testSet", new HashSet<>());

		for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
			this.sendPrivateDeliveryData("b",i+1);
		}
	}
}
```

You can see that we made a private delivery for the b component, called the `this.sendPrivateDeliveryData` method, and specified the b component



Then we look at the b component:

```java
@LiteflowComponent("b")
public class BCmp extends NodeComponent {
	@Override
	public void process() {
		System.out.println("BCmp executed!");
		Integer value = this.getPrivateDeliveryData();
		//do your biz
	}
}
```

The b component calls the `this.getPrivateDeliveryData()` method to get the parameters delivered by the A component. Because the parameters can only be obtained once (implemented with a queue), it is ensured that the parameters obtained by each b component are different.
