Starting from v2.9.0, LiteFlow supports Etcd' rule configuration source.

## Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yomahub</groupId>
    <artifactId>liteflow-rule-etcd</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Configuration

You don't need to configure the `liteflow.ruleSource` path anymore.

Just configure the extra parameters of the plugin:

```properties
liteflow.rule-source-ext-data={\
    "connectStr":"http://localhost:2379,http://localhost:3379,http://localhost:4379",
    "nodePath":"/lite-flow/flow"\
}
```

The above is just an example, you can replace the corresponding configuration with the Etcd of the actual scene.

`connectStr` can be a single node or a cluster. If `nodePath` is not configured, it defaults to `/lite-flow/flow`.

:::tip notice
If you configure in yaml form, this json is a whole string, please enclose it in double quotes, do not configure it in yaml object format
:::

::: danger notice
It should be noted that when using the Etcd configuration source, only the xml configuration is allowed to be stored in the Etcd.
:::

## Auto Refresh

Using this Etcd configuration source plug-in, any rule changes in the Etcd node will be automatically pushed to the business system for real-time refresh. You don't need to do anything.
