Starting from v2.9.0, LiteFlow supports Etcd' rule configuration source.

## Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yomahub</groupId>
    <artifactId>liteflow-rule-etcd</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.3</version>
</dependency>
```

## Configuration

You don't need to configure the `liteflow.ruleSource` path anymore.

Just configure the extra parameters of the plugin:

<code-group>
  <code-block title="Yaml风格配置" active>

```yaml
liteflow:
  rule-source-ext-data-map:
    endpoints: http://127.0.0.1:2379
    chainPath: /liteflow/chain
    scriptPath: /liteflow/script
```
  </code-block>
  <code-block title="Properties风格配置">

```properties
liteflow.rule-source-ext-data={\
    "endpoints":"http://127.0.0.1:2379",\
    "chainPath":"/liteflow/chain",\
    "scriptPath":"/liteflow/script"\
}
```
  </code-block>

</code-group>

## Configuration instructions

| Configuration Item | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| endpoints          | The connection string of zk, which can be a cluster          |
| chainPath          | Your rule directory node (there will be many rules below, one node per rule) |
| scriptPath         | Your script directory node (there will be many scripts below, one node per script) |

## Description of stored data

In etcd, suppose your `chainPath` is: /liteflow/chain

Then each node under this path is a rule, **the key of the node is chainId, and the value is simple EL (`THEN(a,b,c)`)**, for example:

> /liteflow/chain
>
> ---chain1
>
> ---chain2



For the script path, suppose your `scriptPath` is: /liteflow/script

Then each node under this path is a script component. **The key of the node has a fixed format: `script component ID:script type:script name`, and the value is the script data**, for example:

> /liteflow/script
>
> ---s1:script:script component s1
>
> ---s2:script:script component s2

About the script type, you can refer to the section [Defining Script Components](/pages/2523a0/).

## Auto Refresh

Using this Etcd configuration source plug-in, any rule changes in the Etcd node will be automatically pushed to the business system for real-time refresh. You don't need to do anything.

## Example

In order to make it easy for everyone to get started with the configuration of the Etcd rule, here is a small demo that you can pull to run locally, you need to replace the Etcd configuration information.

Before running the project, read the `readme.txt` file in the project.
