Starting from v2.9.0, LiteFlow supports Etcd' rule configuration source.

## Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yomahub</groupId>
    <artifactId>liteflow-rule-etcd</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.2</version>
</dependency>
```

## Configuration

You don't need to configure the `liteflow.ruleSource` path anymore.

Just configure the extra parameters of the plugin:

<code-group>
  <code-block title="Properties Style" active>

```properties
liteflow.rule-source-ext-data={\
    "connectStr":"http://127.0.0.1:2379",\
    "nodePath":"/liteflow/rule"\
}
```
  </code-block>
  <code-block title="Yaml Style">

```yaml
liteflow:
  rule-source-ext-data-map:
    connectStr: http://127.0.0.1:2379
    nodePath: /liteflow/rule
```
  </code-block>
</code-group>

The above is just an example, you can replace the corresponding configuration with the Etcd of the actual scene.

`connectStr` can be a single node or a cluster. If `nodePath` is not configured, it defaults to `/lite-flow/flow`.

:::tip notice
If you configure in yaml form, this json is a whole string, please enclose it in double quotes, do not configure it in yaml object format
:::

::: danger notice
It should be noted that when using the Etcd configuration source, only the xml configuration is allowed to be stored in the Etcd.
:::

## Auto Refresh

Using this Etcd configuration source plug-in, any rule changes in the Etcd node will be automatically pushed to the business system for real-time refresh. You don't need to do anything.

## Example

In order to make it easy for everyone to get started with the configuration of the Etcd rule, here is a small demo that you can pull to run locally, you need to replace the Etcd configuration information.

Before running the project, read the `readme.txt` file in the project.
