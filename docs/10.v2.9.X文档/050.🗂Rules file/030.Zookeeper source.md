## Dependency

LiteFlow supports placing the configuration in the zk cluster, based on the zk notification mechanism, LiteFlow supports real-time modification of the process


If you need to use zk, you need to add the following additional dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yomahub</groupId>
    <artifactId>liteflow-rule-zk</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.0</version>
</dependency>
```



## Configuration

You don't need to configure the `liteflow.ruleSource` path anymore.

Just configure the extra parameters of the plugin:

```properties
liteflow.rule-source-ext-data={"connectStr":"127.0.0.1:21810,127.0.0.1:21811,127.0.0.1:21812", "nodePath":"/your_path/flow"}
```

`connectStr`: The connection information of zk, which can be a single node or a cluster.

`nodePath`: The node path of zk, this parameter is not necessary, if not set, the default is `/lite-flow/flow`.

:::tip notice
If you configure in yaml form, this json is a whole string, please enclose it in double quotes, do not configure it in yaml object format
:::

::: danger notice
It should be noted that when using the zk configuration source, only the xml configuration is allowed to be stored in the zk.
:::

## Auto Refresh

Any rule changes in the zk node will be automatically pushed to the business system for real-time smooth hot refresh. You don't need to do anything.
