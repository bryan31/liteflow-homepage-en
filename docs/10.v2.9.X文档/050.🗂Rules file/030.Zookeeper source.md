## Dependency

LiteFlow supports placing the configuration in the zk cluster, based on the zk notification mechanism, LiteFlow supports real-time modification of the process


If you need to use zk, you need to add the following additional dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yomahub</groupId>
    <artifactId>liteflow-rule-zk</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.3</version>
</dependency>
```



## Configuration

You don't need to configure the `liteflow.ruleSource` path anymore.

Just configure the extra parameters of the plugin:

<code-group>
  <code-block title="Properties Style" active>

```properties
liteflow.rule-source-ext-data={\
    "connectStr":"127.0.0.1:2181,127.0.0.1:2182,127.0.0.1:2183",\
    "nodePath":"/liteflow/rule"\
}
```
  </code-block>
  <code-block title="Yaml Style">

```yaml
liteflow:
  rule-source-ext-data-map:
    connectStr: 127.0.0.1:2181,127.0.0.1:2182,127.0.0.1:2183
    nodePath: /liteflow/rule
```
  </code-block>
</code-group>

## Configuration instructions

| Configuration Item | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| connectStr         | The connection string of zk, which can be a cluster          |
| chainPath          | Your rule directory node (there will be many rules below, one node per rule) |
| scriptPath         | Your script directory node (there will be many scripts below, one node per script) |

## Description of stored data

In ZK, suppose your `chainPath` is: /liteflow/chain

Then each node under this path is a rule, **the key of the node is chainId, and the value is simple EL (`THEN(a,b,c)`)**, for example:

> /liteflow/chain
>
> ---chain1
>
> ---chain2



For the script path, suppose your `scriptPath` is: /liteflow/script

Then each node under this path is a script component. **The key of the node has a fixed format: `script component ID:script type:script name`, and the value is the script data**, for example:

> /liteflow/script
>
> ---s1:script:script component s1
>
> ---s2:script:script component s2

About the script type, you can refer to the section [Defining Script Components](/pages/2523a0/).

## Auto Refresh

Any rule changes in the zk node will be automatically pushed to the business system for real-time smooth hot refresh. You don't need to do anything.

## Example

In order to make it easy for everyone to get started with the configuration of the ZK rule, here is a small demo that you can pull to run locally, you need to replace the ZK configuration information.

Before running the project, read the `readme.txt` file in the project.
