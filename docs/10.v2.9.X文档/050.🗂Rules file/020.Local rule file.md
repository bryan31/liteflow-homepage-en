In the LiteFlow framework, the rule file is the key to drive the entire process, and the user locates the rule file path by specifying the rule-source. rule-source is required, other parameters are not required (all have default values).

The following uses the configuration of Springboot as an example. For the configuration of Spring and non-Spring environments, you can read the [Configuration Items](/pages/b70ec8/) chapter in detail.



## General configuration

```properties
liteflow.rule-source=config/flow.el.xml
```

## Specify multiple paths

Rule files can be separated by `,` or `;`:

```properties
liteflow.rule-source=config/flow1.el.xml,config/flow2.el.xml,config/flow3.el.xml
```

You can also use Spring EL expressions for fuzzy matching to load multiple configuration files:

```properties
liteflow.rule-source=config/**/*.el.xml
```

:::tip tip

Fuzzy matching is limited to Springboot/Spring system, fuzzy matching does not take effect in non-Spring environment
