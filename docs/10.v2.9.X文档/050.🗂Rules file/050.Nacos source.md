Starting from v2.9.0, LiteFlow supports Nacos' rule configuration source.

## Dependency

If using Nacos as the rule configuration source, you need to add the following additional plugin dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yomahub</groupId>
    <artifactId>liteflow-rule-nacos</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.3</version>
</dependency>
```

## Configuration

You don't need to configure the `liteflow.ruleSource` path anymore.

Just configure the extra parameters of the plugin:

<code-group>
  <code-block title="Yaml Style" active>

```yaml
liteflow:
  rule-source-ext-data-map:
    serverAddr: 127.0.0.1:8848
    dataId: demo_rule
    group: DEFAULT_GROUP
    namespace: your namespace id
    username: nacos
    password: nacos
```
  </code-block>
  <code-block title="Properties Style">

```properties
liteflow.rule-source-ext-data={\
    "serverAddr":"127.0.0.1:8848",\
    "dataId":"demo_rule",\
    "group":"DEFAULT_GROUP",\
    "namespace":"your namespace id",\
    "username":"nacos",\
    "password":"nacos"\
}
```
  </code-block>

</code-group>

The above is just an example, you can replace the corresponding configuration with the Nacos of the actual scene.

:::tip notice
If you configure in yaml form, this json is a whole string, please enclose it in double quotes, do not configure it in yaml object format
:::

::: danger notice
It should be noted that when using the Nacos configuration source, only the xml configuration is allowed to be stored in the Nacos.
:::

## Auto Refresh

Using this Nacos configuration source plug-in, any rule changes in the Nacos node will be automatically pushed to the business system for real-time refresh. You don't need to do anything.

## Example

In order to make it easy for everyone to get started with the configuration of the Nacos rule, here is a small demo that you can pull to run locally, you need to replace the Nacos configuration information.

Before running the project, read the `readme.txt` file in the project.
