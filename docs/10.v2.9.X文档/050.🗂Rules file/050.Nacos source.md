Starting from v2.9.0, LiteFlow supports Nacos' rule configuration source.

## Dependency

If using Nacos as the rule configuration source, you need to add the following additional plugin dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yomahub</groupId>
    <artifactId>liteflow-rule-nacos</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Configuration

You don't need to configure the `liteflow.ruleSource` path anymore.

Just configure the extra parameters of the plugin:

```properties
liteflow.rule-source-ext-data={\
    "serverAddr":"192.168.10.147:8848",\
    "dataId":"LiteFlow",\
    "group":"LITE_FLOW_GROUP",\
    "namespace":"your_name_space",\
    "username":"your_user_name",\
    "password":"your_password"\
}
```

The above is just an example, you can replace the corresponding configuration with the Nacos of the actual scene.

:::tip notice
If you configure in yaml form, this json is a whole string, please enclose it in double quotes, do not configure it in yaml object format
:::

::: danger notice
It should be noted that when using the Nacos configuration source, only the xml configuration is allowed to be stored in the Nacos.
:::

## Auto Refresh

Using this Nacos configuration source plug-in, any rule changes in the Nacos node will be automatically pushed to the business system for real-time refresh. You don't need to do anything.
