LiteFlow supports 3 configuration types
- xml
- json
- yml

json, yml, and xml are all configured similarly and will not increase your extra learning burden. Only the form is different.

:::tip tip

**In the following chapters, the examples are basically performed in xml configuration. If you want to change to json and yml, you can refer to the configuration template given in this chapter.**

:::



## The part of the rule

LiteFlow's rule files are very lightweight and easy to use. Mainly consists of `Node` and `Chain`.

:::tip tip
**It must be noted that `Node` is not necessary in the Springboot/Spring environment system, as long as the corresponding component is registered in the context. Of course, if configured in the rules file, the framework will also register the node with the Spring context.**
:::

**In non-Spring environments, `Node` is required. If `Node` is not configured, the system will report an error that the node cannot be found. Be sure to pay attention to this.**



The following format is only used as a template for users' reference.

:::note XML configuration example in three modes
The configuration of rule-source in xml form is as follows:

Local file:liteflow.rule-source=config/flow.el.xml

Custom configuration source:liteflow.rule-source=el_xml:com.yomahub.liteflow.test.TestCustomParser
:::
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<flow>
    <nodes>
        <node id="a" class="com.yomahub.liteflow.test.parser.cmp.ACmp"/>
        <node id="b" class="com.yomahub.liteflow.test.parser.cmp.BCmp"/>
        <node id="c" class="com.yomahub.liteflow.test.parser.cmp.CCmp"/>
        <node id="d" class="com.yomahub.liteflow.test.parser.cmp.DCmp"/>
    </nodes>

    <chain name="chain1">

            a, b, WHEN(c,d)
        );
    </chain>
</flow>
```

<code-block title="JSON format example">
:::note JSON configuration example in three modes
The configuration of rule-source in json form is as follows:

Local file:liteflow.rule-source=config/flow.el.json
