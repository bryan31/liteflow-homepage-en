LiteFlow provides For component since v2.9.0. Returns the number of loops. Mainly used for `FOR...DO...` expressions.

For the usage of `FOR...DO...` expressions, please refer to the chapter on [Loop mode](/pages/6be072/).

You can define it as follows:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    FOR(f).DO(THEN(a, b));
</chain>
```

The definition of the f node needs to inherit `NodeForComponent` and implement the `processFor` method:

```java
@LiteflowComponent("f")
public class FCmp extends NodeForComponent {
    @Override
    public int processFor() throws Exception {
        //here to return the result of for
    }
}
```

See the chapter [Common Components](/pages/8486fb/) for the methods that can be overridden and the methods that can be called by the this keyword.
