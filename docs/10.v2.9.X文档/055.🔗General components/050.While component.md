Starting from v2.9.0, LiteFlow supports loop component, mainly used for `WHILE...DO...` expressions.

For the usage of the `WHILE...DO...` expression, you can refer to [Loop mode](/pages/6be072/).

you can define it as follows:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    WHILE(w).DO(THEN(a, b));
</chain>
```

The definition of the w node needs to inherit `NodeWhileComponent` and implement the `processWhile` method:

```java
@LiteflowComponent("w")
public class WCmp extends NodeWhileComponent {
    @Override
    public boolean processWhile() throws Exception {
        //here to return the result of while
    }
}
```

See the chapter [Common Components](/pages/8486fb/) for the methods that can be overridden and the methods that can be called by the this keyword.
