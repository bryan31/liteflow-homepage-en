In actual business, it is often necessary to determine which node should be executed next through dynamic business logic, which leads to the selection node, which can be used in the `SWITCH` keyword.

For SWITCH expressions, you can refer to the chapter [Switch mode](/pages/d90483/).

Switch node need to inherit `NodeSwitchComponent`.

The method `processSwitch` needs to be implemented.

## Select based on nodeId

For example the following expression:
```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    SWITCH(a).to(b, c);
</chain>
```

This method needs to return the `String` type, which is the specific result. The following code example selects the c node.

```java
@LiteflowComponent("a")
public class ACmp extends NodeSwitchComponent {

    @Override
    public String processSwitch() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Acomp executed!");
        return "c";
    }
}
```

## select based on expression-id

For example the following expression:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    SWITCH(a).to(b, WHEN(c,d).id("w1"));
</chain>
```

If you want to select that expression, you must add id after that expression and assign a string. Then your switch component just returns w1 directly.

```java
@LiteflowComponent("a")
public class ACmp extends NodeSwitchComponent {

    @Override
    public String processSwitch() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Acomp executed!");
        return "w1";
    }
}
```

## select based on tag

For the concept of tags, please refer to the chapter [Component tag](/pages/0f788f/).

The following expression:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    SWITCH(a).to(
        b.tag("cat"),
        c.tag("dog")
    );
</chain>
```

LiteFlow supports tag selection since v2.9.0. If you want to select the c component, the a component can return `c` or `tag:dog`.

See the chapter [Common Components](/pages/8486fb/) for the methods that can be overridden and the methods that can be called by the this keyword.
