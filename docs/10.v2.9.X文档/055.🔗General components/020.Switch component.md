In actual business, it is often necessary to determine which node should be executed next through dynamic business logic, which leads to the selection node, which can be used in the `SWITCH` keyword.

For SWITCH expressions, you can refer to the chapter [Switch mode](/pages/d90483/).

Switch node need to inherit `NodeSwitchComponent`.

The method `processSwitch` needs to be implemented.

## Select based on nodeId

For example the following expression:
```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    SWITCH(a).to(b, c);
</chain>
```

This method needs to return the `String` type, which is the specific result. The following code example selects the c node.

```java
@LiteflowComponent("a")
public class ACmp extends NodeSwitchComponent {

    @Override
    public String processSwitch() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Acomp executed!");
        return "c";
    }
}
```

## select based on expression-id

For example the following expression:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    SWITCH(a).to(b, WHEN(c,d).id("w1"));
</chain>
```

If you want to select that expression, you must add id after that expression and assign a string. Then your switch component just returns w1 directly.

```java
@LiteflowComponent("a")
public class ACmp extends NodeSwitchComponent {

    @Override
    public String processSwitch() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Acomp executed!");
        return "w1";
    }
}
```

## select based on tag

For the concept of tags, please refer to the chapter [Component tag](/pages/0f788f/).

The following expression:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    SWITCH(a).to(
        b.tag("cat"),
        c.tag("dog")
    );
</chain>
```

LiteFlow supports tag selection since v2.9.0. If you want to select the c component, the a component can return `c` or `tag:dog`.

```java
@LiteflowComponent("a")
public class ACmp extends NodeSwitchComponent {

    @Override
    public String processSwitch() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Acomp executed!");
        return "tag:dog";
    }
}
```

The above is the simplest usage, and there are the following usages:

```xml
<chain name="chain4">
    THEN(
        a,
        SWITCH(g).to(b.tag("td"), d.tag("td"))
    );
</chain>
```

Take advantage of simple representations to quickly select what you want:

```java
public class GSwitchCmp extends NodeSwitchComponent {

	@Override
	public String processSwitch() throws Exception {
                return ":td"      // Enter the b node, meaning: select the first node whose tag is td
                return "tag:td"   // Enter the b node, meaning: select the first node whose tag is td
		        return "b";       // Enter the b node, meaning: select the node whose targetId is b
                return "b:";      // Enter the b node, meaning: select the first node whose targetId is b
		        return "b:td";    // Enter the b node, meaning: select the node whose targetId is b and whose tag is td
                return ":";       // Enter the b node, meaning: select the first node
		        return "d";       // Enter the d node, meaning: select the node whose targetId is d
                return "d:";      // Enter the d node, meaning: select the first node whose targetId is d
                return "d:td";    // Enter the d node, meaning: select the node whose targetId is d and the tag is td
                return "b:x";     // Error, reason: there is no node whose targetId is b and tag is x
                return "x";       // Error, reason: there is no node whose targetId is x
                return "::";      // Error, reason: no node with tag ":" found
	}
}
```

See the chapter [Common Components](/pages/8486fb/) for the methods that can be overridden and the methods that can be called by the this keyword.
