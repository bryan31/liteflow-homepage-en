Starting from v2.9.0, LiteFlow provides break component. Returns a Boolean value for the loop count. Mainly used for FOR...DO...BREAK and WHILE...DO...BREAK expressions.

For the usage of these two expressions, please refer to [Loop mode](/pages/6be072/).

It can be defined as follows:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    FOR(f).DO(THEN(a, b)).BREAK(c);
</chain>
```

or

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    WHILE(w).DO(THEN(a, b)).BREAK(c);
</chain>
```

The definition of the c node needs to inherit `NodeBreakComponent` and implement the `processBreak` method:

```java
@LiteflowComponent("c")
public class CCmp extends NodeBreakComponent {
    @Override
    public boolean processBreak() throws Exception {
        //here to return the result of break
    }
}
```

See the chapter [Common Components](/pages/8486fb/) for the methods that can be overridden and the methods that can be called by the this keyword.
