Starting from version 2.8.5, LiteFlow provides the definition of conditional components.

Conditional components can also be called IF components, and the return is a true/false. Can be used for keywords such as `IF...ELIF...ELSE`.

For the usage of `IF...ELIF...ELSE` expressions, please refer to the chapter [If mode](/pages/e76999/).

For example, an IF with three arguments, as shown below, x is the IF component, if true, execute a, if false, execute b:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    IF(x, a, b);
</chain>
```

The definition of the x node needs to inherit the `NodeIfComponent` class:

```java
@Component("x")
public class XCmp extends NodeIfComponent {
	@Override
	public boolean processIf() throws Exception {
	    //do your biz
		return true;
	}
}
```

See the chapter [Common Components](/pages/8486fb/) for the methods that can be overridden and the methods that can be called by the this keyword.
