:::tip notice
`rule-source` is required whenever rules are used.

But if you construct rules dynamically with code, then the `rule-source` configuration is automatically invalid. Because code constructs use code to assemble rules, no rules files are required. For details, please refer to [Dynamic Rules](/pages/9aa85a/).
