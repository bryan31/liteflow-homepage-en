What is a declarative component?

The components introduced in the previous chapters require you to define a class to inherit `NodeComponent` or `NodeSwitchComponent`. This causes coupling on the one hand, and on the other hand, because java is a single inheritance system, users can no longer inherit their own classes, resulting in constraints.

This feature of declarative components allows your custom components to not inherit any classes and implement any interfaces, and ordinary classes can also become LiteFlow components.

Even you can use a class to define multiple components, just rely on annotations to complete, this feature is also called method-level declaration.
