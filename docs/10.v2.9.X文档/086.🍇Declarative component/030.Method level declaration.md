LiteFlow supports method-level declarative features since v2.9.0.

The method level declaration allows users to define multiple components in a class through annotations, which is more flexible.

If you have a lot of components and want to avoid the problem of having too many classes defined, then this feature is very suitable for this need.

You can define multiple components in a bean like this:

```java
@LiteflowComponent
public class CmpConfig {

    //Definition of common components
    @LiteflowMethod(value = LiteFlowMethodEnum.PROCESS, nodeId = "a")
    public void processA(NodeComponent bindCmp) {
        ...
    }

    //Definition of switch components
    @LiteflowMethod(value = LiteFlowMethodEnum.PROCESS_SWITCH, nodeId = "b", nodeType = NodeTypeEnum.SWITCH)
    public void processB(NodeComponent bindCmp) {
        ...
    }
    
    //Definition of if components
    @LiteflowMethod(value = LiteFlowMethodEnum.PROCESS_IF, nodeId = "c", nodeType = NodeTypeEnum.IF)
    public boolean processC(NodeComponent bindCmp) {
        ...
    }
    
    //Definition of for components
    @LiteflowMethod(value = LiteFlowMethodEnum.PROCESS_FOR, nodeId = "d", nodeType = NodeTypeEnum.FOR)
    public int processD(NodeComponent bindCmp) {
        ...
    }
    
    //Definition of while components
    @LiteflowMethod(value = LiteFlowMethodEnum.PROCESS_WHILE, nodeId = "e", nodeType = NodeTypeEnum.WHILE)
    public int processE(NodeComponent bindCmp) {
        ...
    }
    
    //Definition of break components
    @LiteflowMethod(value = LiteFlowMethodEnum.PROCESS_BREAK, nodeId = "f", nodeType = NodeTypeEnum.BREAK)
    public int processF(NodeComponent bindCmp) {
        ...
    }
}
```

::: tip notice1
It should be noted here that for the method-level declaration feature, the `nodeId` on the `@LiteflowMethod` annotation must be written.

The `nodeType` on the common component can be omitted because it has a default value, but for the sake of clarity, it is recommended that you add `nodeType = NodeTypeEnum.COMMON`.
:::

::: tip notice2
When you define a method yourself, the return value should be the same as the return value of the corresponding method in the conventional component. For example, the `process` method of ordinary components does not return, such as the `processIf` method of IF components, which returns a boolean value.

If you write it wrong, a little exception will occur, which may increase your troubleshooting time.
:::

The methods for other components are also declared in a similar way. For example, I define 2 components in a class, and each component implements 3 methods, which can be written as follows:

```java
@LiteflowComponent
public class CmpConfig {

    @LiteflowMethod(value = LiteFlowMethodEnum.PROCESS, nodeId = "a", nodeType = NodeTypeEnum.COMMON)
    public void processA(NodeComponent bindCmp) {
        ...
    }

    @LiteflowMethod(value = LiteFlowMethodEnum.IS_ACCESS, nodeId = "a", nodeType = NodeTypeEnum.COMMON)
    public boolean isAccessA(NodeComponent bindCmp){
        ...
    }

    @LiteflowMethod(value = LiteFlowMethodEnum.ON_SUCCESS, nodeId = "a", nodeType = NodeTypeEnum.COMMON)
    public void onSuccessA(NodeComponent bindCmp){
        ...
    }

    @LiteflowMethod(value = LiteFlowMethodEnum.PROCESS_IF, nodeId = "f", nodeType = NodeTypeEnum.IF)
    public boolean processF(NodeComponent bindCmp) {
        ...
    }

    @LiteflowMethod(value = LiteFlowMethodEnum.IS_ACCESS, nodeId = "f", nodeType = NodeTypeEnum.IF)
    public boolean isAccessF(NodeComponent bindCmp){
        ...
    }

    @LiteflowMethod(value = LiteFlowMethodEnum.ON_SUCCESS, nodeId = "f", nodeType = NodeTypeEnum.IF)
    public void onSuccessF(NodeComponent bindCmp){
        ...
    }
}
```
