The LiteFlow framework currently supports thress scripting languages: Groovy,Javascript,QLExpress.

LiteFlow uses the SPI mechanism to select a scripting framework to dynamically compile your scripts.

If you are not familiar with the syntax of these three scripting languages. There are two tutorials here:

[Groovy Grammar Tutorial](https://www.w3cschool.cn/groovy/)

[Javascript Grammar Tutorial](http://c.biancheng.net/js/)

[QLExpress Grammar tutorial](https://github.com/alibaba/QLExpress)

Groovy script, you need additional dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yomahub</groupId>
    <artifactId>liteflow-script-groovy</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Javascript script, you need additional dependencies:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yomahub</groupId>
    <artifactId>liteflow-script-javascript</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.1</version>
</dependency>
```

QLExpress script, you need additional dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yomahub</groupId>
    <artifactId>liteflow-script-qlexpress</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.1</version>
</dependency>
```

You only need to rely on the corresponding script framework, SPI will dynamically select the script framework to compile and parse your script.

LiteFlow precompiles all scripts at startup, so there is no need to compile each time they are executed, and the running performance is not much different from java.
