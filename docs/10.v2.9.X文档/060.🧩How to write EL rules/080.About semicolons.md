You may have noticed that after the EL rules, the examples are all followed by semicolons.

But when you actually run it, it can run normally without a semicolon.

Should the semicolon be added?

The EL rules of LiteFlow are extended and encapsulated by depending on the underlying expression language. It can be omitted when expressing a single-line statement. for example:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    THEN(a, b, WHEN(c, d))
</chain>
```

The following form is also considered to be a single-line expression

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    THEN(
        a, 
        b, 
        WHEN(c, d)
    )
</chain>
```

When using sub-variables, because it is a multi-line expression, a semicolon must be added, otherwise the parsing will fail and an error will be reported. The correct specification is as follows:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    t1 = THEN(a, b);
    w1 = WHEN(c, d);
    
    THEN(t1, w1);
</chain>
```

:::warning notice

**Official suggestion, whether it is a single line or multiple lines, try to add a semicolon after each expression.**

Because the IDEA plugin of LiteFlow will check the grammar, if there is no semicolon after each expression, there will be a red squiggly line to prompt.

For a single-line expression, even if you ignore the syntax check prompt and run it, it can still run normally, but in the scenario of sub-variables, a semicolon must be added, which should be paid special attention.
