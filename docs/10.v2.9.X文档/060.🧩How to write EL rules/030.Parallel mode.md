## The basic example

If you want to execute the three components a, b, c in parallel, you can use the `WHEN` keyword. It should be noted that `WHEN` must be capitalized.

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    WHEN(a, b, c);
</chain>
```

## Nested with serial (1)

Let's combine `THEN` and `WHEN` to see an example:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    THEN(
        a,
        WHEN(b, c, d),
        e
    );
</chain>
```

:::tip Flow chart
<img :src="$withBase('/img/flow_example/e2.svg')" style="zoom: 80%" class="no-zoom">
:::


In the above example, e will be executed only after b, c, and d.

## Nested with serial (2)

The above example should be well understood, so let's look at another example:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    THEN(
        a,
        WHEN(b, THEN(c, d)),
        e
    );
</chain>
```

:::tip Flow chart
<img :src="$withBase('/img/flow_example/e3.svg')" style="zoom: 80%" class="no-zoom">
:::

## Ignore errors

The `WHEN` keyword provides a subkeyword `ignoreError` (defaults to false) to provide the feature of ignoring errors. The usage is as follows:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    THEN(
        a,
        WHEN(b, c, d).ignoreError(true),
        e
    );
</chain>
```
:::tip Flow chart
<img :src="$withBase('/img/flow_example/e2.svg')" style="zoom: 80%" class="no-zoom">
:::

The above assumes that any node in b, c, and d has an exception, then eventually e will still be executed.

## Any node is executed first and other nodes are ignored

The `WHEN` keyword provides a sub-keyword `any` (default is false) to provide the feature that in the parallel process, any node is executed first, ignoring other node and continuing to execute. The usage is as follows:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    THEN(
        a,
        WHEN(b, THEN(c, d), e).any(true),
        f
    );
</chain>
```
:::tip Flow chart
<img :src="$withBase('/img/flow_example/e4.svg')" style="zoom: 80%" class="no-zoom">
:::

In the above process, if node e is executed first, then node f will be executed immediately regardless of whether other nodes are executed.

## The concept of groups

In previous versions, parallel mode had the concept of groups, and in version 2.8.X, we removed the concept of groups.

With EL expressions, you actually write 2 different WHENs as 2 groups. for example:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    THEN(
        WHEN(a, b, c, d)
    );
</chain>
```
The above abcd are all in the same parallel group.

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    THEN(
        WHEN(a, b)ï¼Œ
        WHEN(c, d)
    );
</chain>
```
In the above example, ab is a parallel group and cd is another parallel group.
