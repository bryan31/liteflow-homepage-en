In some cases, you may write rules with expressions that are nested many levels.

For example, does the following process seem complicated?

:::tip Flow chart
<img :src="$withBase('/img/flow_example/e8.svg')" style="zoom: 80%" class="no-zoom">
:::

In fact, you use regular expressions to write, pay attention to indentation, and it can be easily read. The above graph can be written as the following regular expression:

```xml
<chain name="chain4">
    THEN(
        A, B,
        WHEN(
            THEN(C, WHEN(J, K)),
            D,
            THEN(H, I)
        ),
        SWITCH(X).to(
            M,
            N,
            WHEN(Q, THEN(P, R)).id("w01")
        ),
        Z
    );
</chain>
```



But maybe some people still feel a little complicated.



LiteFlow also supports the definition of sub-chain in the new version of the expression. You can separate and define sub-chain separately, so the above expression can also be written in the following form:

```xml
<chain name="mainChain">
    THEN(
    	A, B,
    	WHEN(chain1, D, chain2),
    	SWITCH(X).to(M, N, chain3),
    	z
    );
</chain>

<chain name="chain1">
  	THEN(C, WHEN(J, K));
</chain>

<chain name="chain2">
  	THEN(H, I);
</chain>

<chain name="chain3">
  	WHEN(Q, THEN(P, R)).id("w01");
</chain>
```



Is it much clearer by splitting it into sub-chain?
