If you want to execute the four components a, b, c, and d in sequence, you can use the `THEN` keyword. It should be noted that `THEN` must be capitalized.

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    THEN(a, b, c, d);
</chain>
```

Of course, if you write it nested, it is equivalent to the above
```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    THEN(a, b, THEN(c, d));
</chain>
```
