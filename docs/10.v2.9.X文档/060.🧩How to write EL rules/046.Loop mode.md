Starting from v2.9.0, LiteFlow provides loop expression syntax.

## FOR

The FOR loop expression is used for a fixed number of loops. The usual usage is:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    FOR(5).DO(THEN(a, b));
</chain>
```

The above expression means that a->b loops 5 times.

If you are not sure how many times to loop when you define the rule, you can also define it like this:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    FOR(f).DO(THEN(a, b));
</chain>
```

The f node needs to be `For Component`, and returns an int loop count. For how to define it, please refer to [For component](/pages/84988c/).

## WHILE

The WHILE loop expression is used for conditional looping and is usually used as:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    WHILE(w).DO(THEN(a, b));
</chain>
```

The w node needs to be `While component` and returns a boolean value. If it is true, the loop will continue. For how to define it, please refer to [While component](/pages/c7338e/).

## BREAK

LiteFlow also supports the BREAK syntax, which means break out of the loop.

The BREAK keyword can be followed by FOR and WHILE, and is usually used as follows:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    FOR(f).DO(THEN(a, b)).BREAK(c);
</chain>
```

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    WHILE(w).DO(THEN(a, b)).BREAK(c);
</chain>
```

The c node needs to be `Break component`, returning a boolean value, and exiting the loop if true. For how to define it, please refer to [Break component](/pages/c41195/).
