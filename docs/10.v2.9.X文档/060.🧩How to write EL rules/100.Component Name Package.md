LiteFlow component names are regulated and cannot start with a number and cannot have arithmetic symbols in between.

For example, these are not working: `88Cmp`, `cmp-11`, `user=123`.

The following such definition is reported as an error at startup.
```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    THEN(a, b, 88Cmp, cmp-11);
</chain>
```


But there are some businesses where component IDs need to be generated automatically and will break this rule.

LiteFlow also provides a component wrapper syntax that allows you to use any form of component name.

You need to use the `node` keyword.

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    THEN(a, b, node("88Cmp"), node("cmp-11"));
</chain>
```

This will work.

Of course a itself is equivalent to node("a").
