Starting from version 2.8.5, LiteFlow provides conditional expression combinations.

Conditional expression is a variant of switch expression, `SWITCH` selects one of multiple subitems based on logic. The conditional expression has only two sub-items, true and false, which is very useful in the process of dealing with certain businesses.

In fact, conditional expression is to become an if else in the language. It's just that there are some different usages in the LiteFlow EL syntax.

The first parameter of the following `IF` and `ELIF` requires the definition of a `conditional component`. For how to define it, please refer to the chapter [conditional component](/pages/cb0b59/).

## IF with two arguments

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    THEN(
        IF(x, a),
        b
    );
</chain>
```
:::tip Flow chart
<img :src="$withBase('/img/flow_example/e11.svg')" style="zoom: 80%" class="no-zoom">
:::

x is a conditional node. If it is true, the execution chain is x->a->b, and if it is false, it is x->b.

## IF with three arguments

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    THEN(
        IF(x, a, b),
        c
    );
</chain>
```
:::tip Flow chart
<img :src="$withBase('/img/flow_example/e12.svg')" style="zoom: 80%" class="no-zoom">
:::

x is a conditional node. If it is true, the execution chain is x->a->c, and if it is false, it is x->b->c.

## ELSE expression

LiteFlow also provides the `ELSE` expression, the `IF` with two arguments + `ELSE` expression is equivalent to the `IF` with three arguments, for example:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    IF(x, a).ELSE(b);
</chain>
```
It is equivalent to:
```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    IF(x, a, b);
</chain>
```

## ELIF expression

The usage of the `ELIF` keyword is actually similar to the else if in the java language. It can be used with multiple `ELIF`, It will be followed by an `ELSE` at the end, which is used to judge multiple conditions:

```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    IF(x1, a).ELIF(x2, b).ELIF(x3, c).ELIF(x4, d).ELSE(THEN(m, n));
</chain>
```

:::tip Flow chart
<img :src="$withBase('/img/flow_example/e13.svg')" style="zoom: 80%" class="no-zoom">
:::

Those who have written code should have a good understanding of this expression.

:::tip notice one
It is worth noting that only the two arguments expression of `IF` can be followed by `ELIF`. If the `IF` with three arguments is followed by `ELIF`, the last expression will be overwritten by the expression of `ELIF`. for example:
```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    IF(x1, a, b).ELIF(x2, c).ELSE(d);
</chain>
```
In this way, even if x1 is false, it will not execute to b, and will judge x2. Although the framework does fault-tolerant processing, it is not recommended to write expressions in this way. It is easy to cause confusion in understanding.

:::tip notice two
In fact, the `IF` with three arguments can already express all possibilities, which can be done by nesting, for example:
```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    IF(
        x1,
        a, 
        IF(
            x2,
            b,
            IF(x3, c, d)
        )
    );
</chain>
```
But it is still not recommended that you write this way. Multiple nesting will be difficult to understand, so try to use `ELIF` instead.
