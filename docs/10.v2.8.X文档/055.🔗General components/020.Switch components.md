In actual business, it is often necessary to determine which node should be executed next through dynamic business logic, which leads to the selection node, which can be used in the `SWITCH` keyword.

For SWITCH expressions, you can refer to the chapter [Switch Component](/pages/d90483/).

For example the following expression:
```xml
<chain name="chain1">
    SWITCH(a).to(b, c);
</chain>
```

Selecting node a needs to inherit the `NodeSwitchComponent` class

The method `processSwitch` needs to be implemented. This method needs to return the `String` type, which is the specific result. The following code example selects the c node.

```java
@LiteflowComponent("a")
public class ACmp extends NodeSwitchComponent {

    @Override
    public String processSwitch() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Acomp executed!");
        return "c";
    }
}
```

See the chapter [Common Components](/pages/8486fb/) for the methods that can be overridden and the methods that can be called by the this keyword.
