## Dependency
:::tip tip
LiteFlow supports placing the configuration in the zk cluster, based on the zk notification mechanism, LiteFlow supports real-time modification of the process

You only need to replace the rule-source path with the zk address in the original configuration process. Of course, the content stored in the ZK is still stored in xml/json/yml. For details, please refer to [Rule file format](/pages/6fa87e/) chapter.
:::

If you need to use zk, you need to add the following dependencies, LiteFlow no longer transitive dependencies after 2.6.3:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.curator</groupId>
    <artifactId>curator-framework</artifactId>
    <version>${curator.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.curator</groupId>
    <artifactId>curator-recipes</artifactId>
    <version>${curator.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

${curator.version} is suggested to be 5.1.0.

## Configuration path

The following uses the configuration of Springboot as an example. For the configuration of Spring and non-Spring environments, you can read the [Configuration Items](/pages/b70ec8/) chapter in detail.

Just change the rule-source to the address of zk, and the clusters are separated by commas.

```properties
liteflow.rule-source=el_xml:127.0.0.1:2181,127.0.0.1:2182,127.0.0.1:2183
```

:::tip About the el_xml tag header

LiteFlow not only supports xml configuration, but also json and yml configuration. The beginning of `el_xml:` indicates that the content read here is the configuration in xml and parsed in EL. Please read the [Rule File Format](/pages/7e3166/) chapter for details about the supported format of the rule file.
