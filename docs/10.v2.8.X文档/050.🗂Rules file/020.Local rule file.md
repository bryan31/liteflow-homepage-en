In the LiteFlow framework, the rule file is the key to drive the entire process, and the user locates the rule file path by specifying the rule-source. rule-source is required, other parameters are not required (all have default values).

The following uses the configuration of Springboot as an example. For the configuration of Spring and non-Spring environments, you can read the [Configuration Items](/pages/b70ec8/) chapter in detail.



## General configuration

```properties
liteflow.rule-source=config/flow.el.xml
```

:::tip notice
The rule file must be defined in the form of xxxx.el.xml. If you define it in the form of xxxx.xml, it is based on the old rule mode. Rules in the EL form will not take effect.
:::


## Specify multiple paths

Rule files can be separated by `,` or `;`:

```properties
liteflow.rule-source=config/flow1.el.xml,config/flow2.el.xml,config/flow3.el.xml
```

You can also use Spring EL expressions for fuzzy matching to load multiple configuration files:

```properties
liteflow.rule-source=config/**/*.el.xml
```

:::tip tip

Fuzzy matching is limited to Springboot/Spring system, fuzzy matching does not take effect in non-Spring environment
