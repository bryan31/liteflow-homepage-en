LiteFlow supports the setting of component aliases, and you can fill in the names that are easy to remember.

If a component alias is set, the corresponding alias will be included when printing out the step information.

The setting of component alias is divided into two cases:

## Springboot & Spring scan type

In most cases, many people are using the springboot/spring framework, so just make the following changes

Replace `@Component` with `@LiteflowComponent` in your defined components:

```java
@LiteflowComponent(id = "a", name = "cmpA")
public class ACmp extends NodeComponent {

	@Override
	public void process() {
		System.out.println("ACmp executed!");
	}
}
```

## Rules file type

In a non-spring system project, the component needs to be defined in the rule file, and the name attribute needs to be added to the `<node>` node:

```xml
<node id="a" name="ÁªÑ‰ª∂A" class="com.yomahub.liteflow.test.config.cmp.ACmp"/>
<node id="b" name="ÁªÑ‰ª∂B" class="com.yomahub.liteflow.test.config.cmp.BCmp"/>
```

## Print
