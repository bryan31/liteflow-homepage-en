Some people need to load configurations in two different formats at the same time for special reasons, even configuration sources, such as:

```properties
liteflow.rule-source=multipleType/flow.el.xml,multipleType/flow.el.json
```

This mode usually fails to parse, but LiteFLow provides a parameter to support this feature. If there is a different type of configuration, you need to add this config:

```properties
liteflow.support-multiple-type=true
```
