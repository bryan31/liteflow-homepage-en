LiteFlow supports component event. There are 2 events supported: success event and failure event.

## Success event

If you override the `onSuccess` method in the component, this method will be called back when the component succeeds.

```java
@LiteflowComponent("a")
public class ACmp extends NodeComponent {

	@Override
	public void process() {
		DefaultContext context = this.getContextBean();
		//do your biz
	}

	@Override
	public void onSuccess() throws Exception {
		DefaultContext context = this.getContextBean();
		//do your biz
	}
}
```

In the success event, you can get the context in the same way.

## Failure event

If you override the `onError` method in the component, the component will call back this method when an exception occurs.

```java
@Component("d")
public class DCmp extends NodeComponent {

	@Override
	public void process() throws Exception{
		//mock throw exception
		throw new NullPointerException();
	}

	@Override
	public void onError() throws Exception {
		DefaultContext context = this.getContextBean();
		//do your biz
	}
}
```

### Note 1

After the `onError` method is executed, because the main chain throws an exception, the entire chain is still in a failed state. Errors thrown by the main process are still recorded in LiteFlowResponse.

### Note 2

If the `onError` method itself throws an error, then the final error thrown is the error in the main chain, and the exception generated by the `onError` method will be printed, but not thrown. for example:

```java
@Component("d")
public class DCmp extends NodeComponent {

	@Override
	public void process() throws Exception{
		//mock throw exception
		throw new NullPointerException();
	}

	@Override
	public void onError() throws Exception {
		throw new IllegalAccessException("The error event itself throws an exception");
	}
}
```

Then the exception in the final response will be `NullPointerException` instead of `IllegalAccessException`, but the `IllegalAccessException` exception will be printed.

### Note 2

After the `onError` method is executed, will the `afterProcess` method still execute (assuming both are implemented)?

Yes, the `afterProcess` method will be executed whether or not an error is thrown.
