## Initialize FlowExecutor

You can easily initialize the `FlowExecutor` processor with the following code:

```java
LiteflowConfig config = new LiteflowConfig();
config.setRuleSource("config/flow.el.xml");
FlowExecutor flowExecutor = FlowExecutorHolder.loadInstance(config);
```

:::danger notice
The rule file must be defined in the form of xxxx.el.xml. If you define it in the form of xxxx.xml, it is based on the old rule mode. Rules in the EL form will not take effect.
:::

For more configuration items, please refer to the [Configuration Items](/pages/b5065a/) chapter.

:::tip notice

It should be noted that it is not recommended to initialize the `FlowExecutor` every time the execution process is performed. The initialization of this object is relatively heavy, and it only needs to be initialized once globally. It is recommended to initialize when the project is started or when it is executed for the first time.

:::

## Execute with FlowExecutor

```java
LiteflowResponse response = flowExecutor.execute2Resp("chain1", "arg");
```

::: tip
This `DefaultContext` is the default context. Users can use their own arbitrary bean as the context to pass in. If they need to pass in their own context, they need to pass the Class attribute of the user bean. For details, please refer to [Data context](/pages/74b4bf/) this chapter.
