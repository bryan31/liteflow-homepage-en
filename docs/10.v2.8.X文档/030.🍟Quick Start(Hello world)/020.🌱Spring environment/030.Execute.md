The same as SpringBoot's execution, there is no difference, you can inject `FlowExecutor` into any of your Spring-managed classes for execution:

```java
@Component
public class YourClass{
    
    @Resource
    private FlowExecutor flowExecutor;
    
    @Test
    public void testConfig(){
        LiteflowResponse response = flowExecutor.execute2Resp("chain1", "arg");
    }
}
```

::: tip notice
This `DefaultContext` is the default context. Users can use their own arbitrary bean as the context to pass in. If they need to pass in their own context, they need to pass the Class attribute of the user bean. For details, please refer to [Data context](/pages/74b4bf/) this chapter.
