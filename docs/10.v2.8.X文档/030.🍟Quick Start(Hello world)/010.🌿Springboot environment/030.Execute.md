Declare the startup class:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
//把你定义的组件扫入Spring上下文中
@ComponentScan({"com.xxx.xxx.cmp"})
public class LiteflowExampleApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(LiteflowExampleApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

Then you can get the flowExecutor in any Spring-hosted class to execute the chain:

```java
@Component
public class YourClass{
    
    @Resource
    private FlowExecutor flowExecutor;
    
    public void testConfig(){
        LiteflowResponse response = flowExecutor.execute2Resp("chain1", "arg");
    }
}
```

::: tip notice
This `DefaultContext` is the default context. Users can use their own arbitrary bean as the context to pass in. If they need to pass in their own context, they need to pass the Class attribute of the user bean. For details, please refer to [Data context](/pages/74b4bf/) this chapter.
