The project provides many test cases. As of the current version, there are more than 860 test cases in the project. Almost all the function points and scenarios mentioned in the document are covered.

**It is strongly recommended that those who want to understand LiteFlow can go to the detailed code in the test case. On the new version, you only need to look at the test cases of the EL mode.**

* liteflow-testcase-el-springboot: test cases in springboot environment (based on EL rules)
* liteflow-testcase-el-springnative: test cases in spring native environment (based on EL rules)
* liteflow-testcase-el-nospring: non-spring system test cases (based on EL rules)
